=== YOURLS IDN ===
Plugin Name: YOURLS IDN
Plugin URI:  http://yourls.org/
Description: Compatibility with Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)
Version:     1.0
Author:      Ozh - http://ozh.org/

THIS PLUGIN REQUIRES YOURLS 1.5.1-beta AT LEAST. 

== Installation ==

* Create a directory named 'yourls-idn/' into your 'user/plugins/' directory
* Upload all files contained in this archive into that newly created directory
* Head to your YOURLS admin area and the Plugins management page, then activate
  the YOURLS IDN plugin.
    
== Configuration ==

Before you activate the plugin, you must ensure that your config.php is correct.

The constant YOURLS_SITE must be set to your domain with ACE (Punnycode) notation.
It must not contain any UTF8 or funky character.

For instance, if your YOURLS' URL is:
      http://héhé.com
You must have:
      define('YOURLS_SITE', 'http://xn--hh-bjab.com');
	  
To convert from IDN to ACE (or Punnycode, the one that starts with xn--), you can
use a tool like [this one from VeriSign](https://www.verisign.com/en_GB/channel-resources/domain-registry-products/idn/idn-conversion-tool/index.xhtml)
